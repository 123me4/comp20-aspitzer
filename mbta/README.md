# 123me4 MBTA lab
### Completeness
Done late.  Made the map, centered it, added markers, changed icons (i had wanted to use the bus station icon, but found the library icon easier to use), added polylines.

### Help
I discussed this lab briefly with my dad, mostly to troubleshoot why the map 
had 0 height.  As it turns out, putting the HTML <style></style> tags in the css
document does not work.  Who knew?  :)

Other than that, it was just me and google.  StackExchange was a third wheel.

### Time
This assignment took ~5.5 hours total to complete (~3.5 of them were after the deadline).
