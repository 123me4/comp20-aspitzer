# 123me4 MBTA lab
### Completeness
Not at all.  I was only able to make a map centered on south station.
I was unable to complete the lab due to poor time management.  
This past week-and-a-half have been hectic, mostly due to family events,
travel, expired legal documents, lost legal documents, etc.  Really just excuses,
but I don't intend to let this happen again.

### Help
I discussed this lab briefly with my dad, mostly to troubleshoot why the map 
had 0 height.  As it turns out, putting the HTML <style></style> tags in the css
document does not work.  Who knew?  :)

### Time
This assignment was not completed.
