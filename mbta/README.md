# 123me4 MBTA lab
### Completeness
I added my location, the polyline when i click, and an infowindow to pop up when I click a station icon, but by the time I started trying to format the arrival times, the API gave me this: {"data":[],"jsonapi":{"version":"1.0"}}
I'll continue to work on this after the deadline but this is literally the best I can do right now.\UPDATE\I made the arrival times and directions display.


### Help
This lab was probably more StackExchange and W3C look ups than all the others.  Thats where all my help came from.

### Time
This assignment took ~3 hours before the API crapped on me, and another hour was spent trying to find out why everything was undefined.  Half an hour was then spent seeing if I could work informationless, and now I chose to stop and hope the API is working tomorrow.\UPDATE\It took me 2 more hours of work on Thursday afternoon to make the train schedule display properly.
