# 123me4 Lab 13
### Completeness
I only really found 2 issues, not the 3 required.  I also didn't add screenshots of my encountering the issues.  But other than that, I feel I completed the assignment, and learned a lot about internet security, as simplistic as this may have been.

### Help
My father and I had trouble getting a mongo database to run for a local version of the code.  Other than that though, It was just me and google.

### Time
This assignment took the better of 5 hours, mostly playing with XSS, and a long time spent trying to drop your tables (even though that one didn't end up happening).
